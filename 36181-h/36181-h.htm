<p class="p4 center"><a name="pg_0"></a>INTRODUCTION</p>

<p class="p2">Historians may trace in the Royal charters issued to the
Virginia Company of London a course of empire; a Company organized for
profit by the ablest businessmen of their time&mdash;merchants,
manufacturers, statesmen, and artists who bound themselves together in a
joint stock enterprise. The historian may also find in the three
charters here published a pattern for a parliamentary system and its
development into the American form of government. He might even perceive
the inception of a new society.</p>

<p>The origin of the joint stock company was probably primitive. Its
later genesis may readily be seen in the medieval guild. It became an
English institution in its application by Sir Walter Raleigh to his
magnificent adventures in both honest trade and romantic piracy.</p>

<p>The Company provided an agency for assembling adventure capital and
supplying able management to enterprises of great moment. It offered an
invitation to the industrious to participate in the growing wealth and
expanding power of the great English middle class. It supplied an
opportunity to small investors and it limited their liability. It was an
adaptation by practical people to practical problems.</p>

<p>Subscribers, or shareholders, met in their quarterly courts to
discuss the business of the Company and participate in its management.
These courts were the counterpart of our present day corporate
stockholders' meetings and were characterized by the same sort of
discussions. King James could protest vehemently against the
"democratical principles of the Company." He could see in their charters
the final death warrant of feudalism. He could execute Raleigh "chiefly
for giving satisfaction to the King of Spain." He could revoke the
charters in 1624, but he could not stop the rising tide of
representative institutions nor darken the great vision of the liberal
Elizabethans. A new day had dawned.</p>

<p>The General Assembly which met at Jamestown in 1619 was the natural
child of the Company. Some of the planters along the James River were
shareholders in the Company. They had a voice in its management. In the
management of the civil affairs of the Colony it was, therefore, logical
that the plantations should elect their representatives to the local
governing body. It was thus that the first freely elected parliament of
a self-governing people in the Western World came into existence. Its
principles were based on those of the corporation chartered and
organized for profit by businessmen.</p>

<p>The three charters here published, changed successively to meet
changing conditions, were the rules and the by-laws for the commercial,
economic, and political development of a homogeneous, industrious
English society in a land of opportunity. The principal authors and
executors of the charters, Sir Thomas Smith and Sir Edwin and George
Sandys, were businessmen. They were practical men. They found a
practical way to assemble capital and ability, and coordinate them in
constructive enterprise.</p>

<p>A hundred years before the great Virginia adventure, Luther, Erasmus,
and Columbus rang down the curtain on the weary and confined drama of
the Middle Ages. Expanding horizons challenged man's vision and
intellect. Great courage made Englishmen adventurers in all things.</p>

<p>The charters here presented are among the world's great documents.
The first which was drawn while Sir Edward Coke was Lord Chief Justice
is replete with certain traditional and feudal principles, reverence for
the English common law and the supreme authority of the King and his
agents. The second, principally the work of the liberal Sir Edwin Sandys
with the approving participation of Sir Francis Bacon, great exponent of
natural law, marks a transition from government by arbitrary royal
authority to the concept that government rests on the consent of the
governed and on the fundamental right of man to enjoy the fruits of his
labor. Students may read in this charter the first principles of the
American Constitution. The third charter is an attempt to refine
principles enunciated in the second in the light of experience. In
addition to its political significance, the second charter proved a
tremendous stimulus to the Virginia enterprise.</p>

<p>Gondomar, the Spanish Ambassador, wrote to his King that "fourteen
Counts and Barons have given 40,000 ducats, the merchants give much more
and there is no poor little man or woman who is not willing to subscribe
something." The landed aristocracy, gentry, merchants, and yeomen had
joined in a company which they directed to provide capital and ability
for a great enterprise.</p>

<p>The text of the three charters of the Virginia Company is taken from
a contemporary copy recently discovered among the Chancery Rolls of the
Public Record Office in London&mdash;contemporary enrollments
"representing the official text of the charters kept in official
custody," according to the Deputy Keeper, Mr. D. L. Evans. A photostatic
copy of this manuscript is in possession of the Virginia State Library.
Each charter was transcribed in England by Doctor Nellie J. M. Kerling
for the editor's use.</p>

<p>Heretofore scholars have had access to the charters only through the
text in William Stith's <i>The History of the First Discovery and
Settlement of Virginia</i> (Williamsburg, Printed by William Parks,
1747), in sources based upon this, or in Alexander Brown's <i>The
Genesis of the United States</i> (Boston, 1890).</p>

<p>No original of any of the charters is known to exist, although other
copies of varying degrees of completeness have been located in England
and on the continent. One copy, made with the authority of the Governor,
Council, and House of Burgesses of the Colony, was used as evidence to
support a petition against Lord Culpeper's land grants. This is included
in the Henry Coventry papers in the library of the Marquess of Bath at
Longleat, Wiltshire, England (Vol. LXXVI, <i>Papers relating to
Virginia, Barbados, and other Colonies, 1606-1675</i>). These documents
have been microfilmed by the American Council of Learned Societies,
"British Manuscripts Project." Many of them will soon be published by
the Virginia Historical Society under the editorship of Dr. W. E.
Washburn.</p>

<p>Another copy of the charters is in the Public Record Office, "Entry
books of letters, commissions, instructions, charters, warrants,
patents, grants, etc." (formerly "Record book No. LXXIX"), an abstract
of which appears in the <i>Calendar of State Papers, Colonial
Series</i>, Vol. I. Microfilm copies of this text are in the Library of
Congress and the Virginia State Library. Other copies have recently been
discovered in France and Spain by Dr. George Reese who has been employed
by the Virginia 350th Anniversary Celebration Corporation to search
foreign libraries for documentary material pertinent to the study of
17th century Virginia. Ultimately, microfilm copies of these records
will be made available to research libraries in the United States.</p>

<p>The seven accompanying documents, included to illustrate the
practical rather than theoretical basis of the administration of the
Colony, have been taken from the best available manuscript or printed
source. These official papers, together with the three charters of the
Virginia Company, may be termed the constitutions and are the basic
sources for the study of the Colony during the first fifteen years of
its existence.</p>

<p>A few necessary liberties have been taken in transcribing these
documents: abbreviations and contractions have been spelled out,
capitalization and punctuation have been adjusted according to modern
usage and, to prevent possible confusion, certain letters used
interchangeably (such as "i" and "j", "v" and "u") are employed
according to twentieth century practice. In the text of the three
charters, omitted words or phrases have been supplied in brackets from
the text in Stith. Brackets are also employed to supply the name of an
adventurer if there is any deviation in spelling between Stith and the
manuscript version: <i>e.g.</i>, "Sir Charles Willmott, Knight
[Wilmot]."</p>

<p>This publication owes its issuance to the inspiration and leadership
furnished by Dr. Earl G. Swem, Librarian Emeritus of the College of
William and Mary. I should like also to acknowledge the faithful
transcription of the text by Dr. Nellie J. N. Kerling, and the deep
interest and active support of Dr. Gertrude R. B. Richards, who most
patiently assisted in the transcription; also to Mr. Francis L.
Berkeley, Jr., Archivist of the Alderman Library, University of Virginia
and to Mr. John M. Jennings, Director of the Virginia Historical
Society. To Mr. James A. Servies, Reference Librarian of the Library of
William and Mary College, has fallen the arduous and difficult task of a
comparative, detailed study of all the texts in the different versions.
The printed text in these pages is from a typed copy by Mr. Servies,
prepared with the most painstaking application, as the result of the
comparison of copies transcribed by Dr. Kerling and Dr. Richards, and of
the printed pages in Stith. The merit of an accurate and readable text
must be ascribed to the industry and scholarly perception of Mr.
Servies.</p>

fullie, largely, amplie and absolutely as if they and everie of them had

ORDERS AND CONSTITUCIONS ...<br />
TO SR THOMAS GATES KNIGHT GOVERNOR<br />
OF VIRGINIA"</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">May, 1609</span></p>

<p class="p2 blockquote">Instructions, orders and constitucions by way
of advise sett downe, declared and propounded to Sir Thomas Gates,
Knight, Governor of Virginia and of the Colony there planted and to be
planted, and of all the inhabitants thereof, by us His Majesties
Counsell for the direction of the affaires of that countrey for his
better disposinge and proceedinge in the government thereof accordinge
to the authority and power given unto us by virtue of His Majesties
lettres patents.</p>

<p>1. Havinge considered the greate sufficiency and zealous affection
which you, Sir Thomas Gates, have many waies manifested unto us, and
havinge therefore by our Commission under our hands and seales
constituted and ordained you to be the Governor of Virginia, wee His
Majesties Counsell for that plantacion, have consulted and advised uppon
divers instructions for your safer and more deliberate proceedinge
therein; and therefore doe requier and charge you, accordinge to the
Comission in that behalf directed unto you, presently with all
convenient speede to take the charge and of our fleete consistinge of
eight good shippes and one pinnace and of sixe hundred land men to be
transported under your commaund, and with the first winde to sett saile
for Virginia. And in your passage thither you shall not land nor touch
any of the Kinge of Spaines his Dominions quetly possessed, without the
leave or licence of the governor of such place as you shal by accident
or contrary windes be forced into. You shall also hold counsell with the
masters and pilotts and men of the best experience what way is safest
and fittest for you to take, because we hold it daungerous that you
should keepe the old course of Dominico and Meins lest you fall into the
hand of the Spaniard, who may attend in that roade ready to intercept
you:</p>

<p>2. When it shall please God that you have safely attained the Kings
River, and our porte and seate of James Towne in Virginia, wee advise
you to call by proclamacion into some publique place, all the governors,
officers, and other His Majesties subjects aswell already seated there
as transported with you, to whom you shall cause your Commission to be
directly reade, whereby significacion may be had of His Majesties
pleasure in establishinge you the Governor of that countrey and
plantacion, and the President, Councell and Colony there may take notice
of the revocacion of that fourme of governement by the first lettres
patents constituted and confirmed, and accordingly yeald due obedience
unto you, their Governor.</p>

<p>3. You shall demaund then and resume into your hands the former
lettres pattents and all instruccions &amp; publique instruments given
or sent unto them and all bookes and records whatsoever of the generall
proceedings untill this time, and dispose of them in the future
accordinge to your discrecion.</p>

<p>4. Beinge setled in your government, you shall call unto you, for
your further advise and graver proceedinge, their principall officers
and gentlemen whom we do ordaine and appointe to be of the Councell and
who for earliness of their undertakings and their greate paines and
merits doe well deserve this honor &amp; respect from us: Sir George
Summers, Knight, and Admirall of Virginia; Captaine John Smith, nowe
President; Captaine John Radclif; Captaine Peter Winne, Seirjant Major
of the fort; Mr. Mathewe Scrivenor, whom out of our good experience of
his abilities in that kinde we doe name and appointe to be Secretary of
that Councell; Captaine John Martine; Captaine Richard Waldoe, master of
the workes; Captaine Woode; and Mr. Fleetwoode, whom we assure ourselves
you will use with all good respecte in their places and to whome wee
expecte that you shall give such other preferrements as their former
paines have deserved, and in all matters of importance we require you to
call them to consultacion and to proceede therein with their advice; and
wee doe give further power and authority to you, to give the oathe of
Counsellor to such as are now named, or any other oathe in the like
case, accordinge to your direccion. Provided that they shall not have,
single nor together, anie bindinge or negative voice or power uppon your
conclusions but doe give you full authority, uppon just occasion to
sequester any of them from the execucion of any place whatsover, and to
depute another thereunto untill significacion unto us be here made:</p>

<p>5. You shall have power and authority to dispose and graunte any
other officer or commaunds whatsoever, either of governement or warr,
except such as are already disposed of by us to any persons of rancke or
merite (adventurers beings first regarded), accordinge to your
discrecion and so discharge or revoke the same or to sequester any so
made or constituted by us.</p>

<p>6. You shall take principall order and care for the true and reverent
worship of God that his worde be duely preached and his holy sacraments
administred accordinge to the constitucions of the Church of England in
all fundamentall pointes, and his ministers had in due observance and
respecte agreeable to the dignity of their callinge. And that all
atheisme, prophanes, popery, or schisme be exemplarily punished to the
honor of God and to the peace and safety of his Church, over which, in
this tendernes and infancy, you must be especially solicitous &amp;
watchefull.</p>

<p>7. You shall, with all propensenes and diligence, endeavour the
conversion of the natives to the knowledge and worship of the true God
and their redeemer Christ Jesus, as the most pious and noble end of this
plantacion, which the better to effect you must procure from them some
convenient nomber of their children to be brought up in your language
and manners, and if you finde it convenient, we thinke it reasonable you
first remove from them their Iniocasockes or Priestes by a surprise of
them all and detaininge them prisoners, for they are so wrapped up in
the fogge and miserie of their iniquity and so tirrified with their
continuall tirrany, chained under the bond of deathe unto the divell
that while they live amounge them to poison and infecte them their
mindes, you shall never make any great progres into this glorious worke,
nor have any civill peace or concurre with them. And in case of
necessity or conveniency, we pronounce it not crueltie nor breache of
charity to deale more sharpely with them and to proceede even to dache
[death?] with these murtherers of soules and sacrificers of God's images
to the divill, referringe the consideracion of this as a waighty matter
of important consequence to the circumstances of the busines and place
in your discrecion.</p>

<p>8. You shall for capitall and criminal justice in case of rebellion
and mutiny and in all such cases of [provident (?)] necessity, proceede
by martiall lawe accordinge to your comission as of most dispatch and
terror and fittest for this governement; and in all other causes of that
nature as also in all matters of civill justice, you shall finde it
properest and usefullest for your governement to proceede rather as a
chauncelor than as a judge, rather uppon the naturall right and equity
then uppon the nicenes and lettre of the lawe which perplexeth in this
tender body, rather then dispatcheth all causes so that a summary and
arbitrary way of justice discreetely mingled with those gravities and
fourmes of magistracy as shall in your discrecion seeme aptest for you
and that place, wilbe of most use both for expedicion and for
example:</p>

<p>9. You shall for the more regard and respect of your place, to begett
reverence to your authority and to refresh their mindes that obey the
gravity of those lawes under which they were borne; at your discrecion
use such fourmes and ensignes of governement as by our lettres pattents
wee are enabled to grant unto you; as also the attendance of a guarde
uppon your person, and in all such like cases you shall have power to
make, adde or distinguishe any lawes or ordinances at your discrecion
accordinge to the authority limited in your comission.</p>

<p>10. You shall, for the choice of plantacions observe two generall
rulles: that you rather seeke to the sun then from it, which is under
God the first cause both of health and riches; and that such places
which you resolve to build and inhabite uppon have at the leaste one
good outlett into the sea &amp; fresh water to the land; that it be a
dry and wholesome earth and as free from woode as possiblie you may,
whereby you may have roome to discover about you and unshady ground to
plant nere you.</p>

<p>11. You must in every plantacion principally provide of your owne a
common graunge and storehowse of corne, besides that which you will
obtaine by tribute or trade with the natives.</p>

<p>12. In the distribucion of your men accordinge to these advises and
relacions which wee have receaved, we advise you to continue the
plantacion at James Towne with a convenient nomber of men, but not as
your situacion or citty, because the place is unwholsome and but in the
marish of Virginia, and to keepe it onely as a fitt porte for your
shippes to ride before to arive and unlade att; butt neither shall you
make it your principall storehowse or magazin either of armes, victualls
or goods, but because it is so accessable with shippinge that an enemy
may be easily uppon you with all the provision of ordinance and municion
and it is not to be expected that anie fortificacion there can endure an
enemy that hath the leasure to sitt downe before it.</p>

<p>13. The place you chose for your principall residence and seate to
have your catle, provisions of corne, foode, and magazin of other
municion in, as your greatest strength, trust and retraite, must be
removed some good distance from any navigable river, except with small
boates, by which no enemy shall dare to seeke your habitacion; and if in
this place some good fortificacion be made to which no ordinance can be
brought by water, if you be provided of victuall, you may dispute
possession till a straunger be wearied and starved.</p>

<p>14. Above the over falles of the Kinges River it is likely you shall
finde some convenient place to this purpose whither no enemy with ease
can approache nor with ordinance at all but by land, with at howe greate
disadvauntage he shall seeke when he must discover and fight at once
uppon straightes, in woodes, at foordes, and places of all
inconveniency, is easy to be considered; besides, you shall have the
commodity of the braunche of the river to bringe downe your provisions
from within the land in canooes and smalle boates in the River of
Chechehounnack, neere unto you and not farre of another navagable
outlett into the sea by the River of Pamaouke.</p>

<p>15. Foure dayes journey from your forte southewards is a towne called
Ohonahorn seated where the River of Choanocki devideth it self into
three braunches and falleth into the sea of Rawnocke in thirtie five
degrees; this place, if you seeke by Indian guides from James forte to
Winocke by water, from thence to Manqueocke, some twenty miles from
thence to Caththega, as much and from thence to Oconahoen, you shall
finde a brave and fruiteful seate every way unaccessable by a straunger
enemy, much more abundant in pochon and in the grasse silke called Cour
del Cherva and in vines, then any parte of this land knowne unto us.
Here we suppose, if you make your principall and cheife seate, you shall
doe most safely and richely because you are in the part of the land
inclined to the southe, and two of the best rivers will supply you;
besides you are neere to riche copper mines of Ritanoc and may passe
them by one braunche of this river, and by another, Peccarecamicke,
where you shall finde foure of the Englishe alive, left by Sir Walter
Rawely, which escaped from the slaughter of Powhaton of Roanocke, uppon
the first arrivall of our Colonie, and live under the proteccion of a
wiroane called Gepanocon, enemy to Powhaton by whose consent you shall
never recover them; one of these were worth much labour, and if you
finde them not, yet seach [search?] into this countrey, it is more
probable then towards the north.</p>

<p>16. These three habitations seeme enoughe for the nomber of the
people nowe transported, over every one of which you must appointe a
discreete commaunder that shall sett your men to severall workes
accordinge to their undertakings in the bookes by which they were
receaved; in every one of these there must be builte a church and a
storehowse and a parte of land sett out for corne for the publique and
some allotted to the care of manuringe and preparinge thereof. In
buildinge your towns you shall as easily keepe decorous and order as
confusion; and so you shall prepare for ornament and safety at once, for
every streete may answere one another and all of them the markett place
or storehowse in the midle which at the leaste must be paved and made
firme and dry.</p>

<p>17. Your enemies can be but of two sortes, straungers and natives;
for the first, your defence must be uppon advauntage of the place and
way unto it, for fortes have no other use but that a fewe men may defend
and dispute their footinge with them against a greater nomber and to
winne time which, if you can do, a stranger cannot longe abide where he
must bringe all his releis [relief?] with him, and he shall have no way
to beseidge you but by blockinge you in and plantinge between you and
the sea, to which if you have two outeletts he must be very able and
powerfull that can do it; to prevent this you shall build some small
forte that may discry the sea neere Cape Comforte, and there hold a
reasonable garrison and keepe alwaies watch and longe boate that may be
ready to take the alarum and able to cary away our men, and munition if
you shall not be able to defend it. Besides it is not safe to lett any
of the savages dwell betwene you and the sea least they be made guides
to your enemies. To this commaunde wee desire Captaine Smith may be
allotted aswell for his earnest desire as the greate confidence &amp;
trust that we have in his care &amp; diligence.</p>

<p>18. The second enemy is the natives who can no way hurte you but by
fire or by destroyinge your catle, or hinderinge your workes by stealth
or your passages in small nombers; and in this sorte of warr there is
most perill if you be not very carefull, for if they may destroy but one
harvest or burne your townes in the night they will leave you naked and
exposed to famine and cold, and convey themselves into wodes where
revenge wilbe as difficult as unnecessary; to prevent that you must
keepe good watches in the fielde and suffer none of them to come nere
your corne in those daungerous seasons; and continuall centinells
without the walles or uttermost defences in the night; and you must give
order that your catle be kept in heards waited and attended on by some
small watch or so enclosed by them selves that they destroy not your
corne and other seed provisions.</p>

<p>19. For Powhaton and his Weroances it is clere even to reason beside
our experience that he loved not our neighbourhood and therefore you may
no way trust him, but if you finde it not best to make him your prisoner
yet you must make him your tributary, and all other his weroances about
him first to acknowledge no other lord but Kinge James, and so we shall
free them all from the tirrany of Powhaton ... uppon them. Every lord of
a province shall pay you and send you into your forte where you make
your cheif residence so many measures of corne at every harvest, soe
many basketts of dye, so many dozens of skins, so many of his people to
worke weekely, and of every thinge somewhat, accordinge to his
proporcion in greatenes of territory and men; by which meanes you shall
quietly drawe to your selves an annuall revenue of every commodity
growinge in that countrey and this tribute payd to you, for which you
shall deliver them from the exeacions of Powhaton which are now
burdensome, and protect and defend them from all their enemies; shall
also be a meanes of clearinge much ground of wood and of reducing them
to laboure and trade seinge for this rent onely they shall enjoye their
howses, and the rest of their travell quietly and many other commodities
and blessings of which they are yet insensible.</p>

<p>20. If you hope to winne them and to provide for your selves by trade
you wilbe deceaved, for already your copper is embased by your abundance
and neglect of prisinge it and they will never feede you but for feare.
Wherefore, if you perceave that they, uppon your landinge, fly up into
the countrey and forsake their habitacion, you must seise into your
custody half there corne and harvest and their Weroances and all other
their knowne successors at once whom, if you intreate well and educate
those which are younge and to succeede in the governement in your
manners and religion, their people will easily obey you and become in
time civill and Christian.</p>

<p>21. If you make freindship with any of these nations, as you must
doe, choose to doe it with those that are farthest from you and enemies
unto those amonge whom you dwell, for you shall have least occasion to
have differences with them and by that meanes a suerer league of amity,
and you shalbe suer of their trade partely for covetousnes and to serve
their owne ends, where the copper is yett in his primary estimacion
which Pohaton hath hitherto engrossed and partely for feare of
constrainte. Monocon, to the east and head of our river, Powhatons
enemy; and the Manahockes, to the northeast to the head of the River of
Moyompo in the necke of the land to the west betweene our bay and the
sea; Cathcatapeius, a greater Weroance then he is, also his enemy to the
Southeast and South&mdash;he hath no freinde to the north; the
Masawoymekes make continuall incursions uppon him and uppon all those
that inhabite the Rivers of Bolus and Myomps and to the northwest;
Pocoughtuwonough infecteth him with a terrible warr. With those you may
hold trade and freindeship good cheape for their emotenes [remoteness?]
will prevent all offence which must needes happen betweene us and them
which we are mingled with to the North. At the head bay is a large towne
where is store of copper and furres called Cataaneon that trade and
discovery wilbe to greate purpose, if it may be setled yearely.</p>

<p>22. Such trade as you shall finde necessary or profitable for you
with the Indians you shall endeavour to drawe them to seeke of you and
to bringe their commodities into your forte, which will greatly ease the
imployment of many men, and this you may bringe to passe by seeminge to
make litle estimacion of trade with them and by pretendinge to be so
able to consist within your selves as that you neede care for nothinge
of theires, but rather that you doe them a curtesy to spare such
necessaries as they want as leetle iron tooles, or copper, or the like
such as are convenient for traffique; and so one officer or two in every
forte, whom you must onely appointe to be truncmasters, may dispatch the
whole busines of trade which els will cost you many mens laboures if you
seeke it far from home. And besides these you must, by proclamacion or
edicte publiquely affixed, prohibite and forbidd uppon paine or
punishement of your discrecion all other persons to trade or exchange
for anythinge but such as shalbe necessarie for foode or clothinge; and
uppon all such commodities of yours as shall passe away from you
whatsoever, you must sett prises and values under which the
trunckemaster must not trade, and so you shalbe such to uphold the
reputacion of your commodity and to make your traffique rich, desired
and certaine; over this truncemaster there must be appointed a cape
merchant or officer belonginge to the store or provision house that must
deliver by booke all such things as shalbe allowed for trade and receave
and take an accounte of whatsover is retourned, accordinge to the prises
therein sett, and so beinge booked must store them up, to the publique
use of the colony.</p>

<p>23. You must constitute and declare some sharpe lawe with a penaltie
thereon to restraine the trade of any prohibited goods, especially of
swordes, pikeheads, gunnes, daggers, or any thinge of iron that may be
turned against you, and in case of such offence punishe severely; have
also especially regard that no arte or trade tendinge to armes in any
wise, as smithey, carpentry, of or such like, be taught the savages or
used in their presence, as they may learne therein.</p>

<p>24. Havinge deduced your colony into severall seates and plantacions
that may commodiously answere and receive one another, you must devide
your people into tennes, twenties, &amp; so upwards, to every necessary
worke a competent nomber, over every one of which you must appointe some
man of care and [skill] in that worke to oversee them and to take daily
accounte of their laboures; and you must ordaine that every overseer of
such a nomber of workemen deliver once a weeke an accounte of the wholle
committed to his charge [to] the cheife governor or captaine of the
fourte; and that they also once a moneth make the like accounte to you
or your officer and that such goodes or provisions as are advanced or
gotten above expence may be receaved and entred into the capemarchantes
booke and so stored and preserved to the publique use of the colony. And
thus you shall both knowe howe your men are imployed, what they gett
&amp; where it is, as also the measure of your provision and wealth.</p>

<p>25. For such of your men as shall attend any worke in or nere aboute
every towne, you shall doe best to lett them eate together at seasonable
howers in some publique place, beinge messed by sixe or five to a messe,
in which you must see there bee equality and sufficient that so they may
come and retourne to their worke without any delay and have no cause to
complaine of measure or to excuse their idlenes uppon the dressinge or
want of diett. You may well allowe them three howers in a somers day and
two in the winter, and shall call them together by ringinge of a bell
and by the same worne them againe to worke; for such as attend any
labouer so farre from the forte, as they cannot returne at seasonable
times, there must be a steward appointed that shall oversee there diett
and provision, els thoughe you give every one a reasonalbe allowance for
many dayes some will eate two meales at one &amp; soe:</p>

<p>26. You shall give especiall order to the cheif commaunder of every
forte that the armes, powder and munition be well stored and looked into
and that the men be disposed into severall companies for warr and
captaines appointed over every fifty to traine them at convenient times
and to teache them the use of their armes and weapons and they may knowe
whether uppon all occasions and sudden attempts they shall repaire to
find them in a readines.</p>

<p>27. You must take especiall care what relacions come into England and
what lettres are written and that all thinges of that nature may be
boxed up and sealed and sent to first to the Councell here, accordinge
to a former instruccion unto the late president in that behalf directed;
and that at the arivall and retourne of every shippinge you endeavour to
knowe all the particuler passages and informacions given on both sides
and to advertise us accordingly.</p>

<p>28. Whensoever you consult of any busines of importance, wee advise
you to consider and deliberate all thinges patiently &amp; willingly and
to heare every man his oppinion and objeccion, but the resultants out of
them or your owne determinacion what you intend to doe not to imparte to
any whatsoever, but to such onely as shall execute it, and to them also
under the sealle of your commaundement and but at the instant of their
partinge from you or the execucion of your will.</p>

<p>29. Next after buildinge, husbandry and manuringe the countrey for
the provision of life and conveniency, wee comend unto your care foure
principall waies of enrichinge the colonies and providinge returne of
commodity, of which you must be very solicitouse that our fleetes come
not home empty nor laden with useles marchandize. The first is discovery
either of the southe seas or royall mines, in the search of both which
we must referre you to the circumstances of your peace and your owne
discrecion; the second is trade whereby you recover all the commodities
of those countreys that ly far of and yet are accessable by water; the
third is tribute, by which you shall advaunce parte of what soever the
next lande can provide you can produce; the fourth is labour of your
owne men in makinge wines, pitche, tarre, sope, ashes, steele, iron,
pipestaves, in sowinge of hempe and flaxe, in gatheringe silke of the
grasse, and providinge the worme and in fishinge for pearle, codd,
sturgion, and such like.</p>

<p>30. Wee require you to call before you Captaine John Radcliffe and
one ... Webbe who hath complained by peticion delivered unto you of
divers injuries and insolences done unto him in the governement of the
said Captaine Radcliffe, and accordingly to heare the cause and doe
justice in it as you shall finde reason in it your owne discrecion.</p>

<p>31. Whereas suite hath bine made unto us as for the retourne of
Richard Potts, David Wiffin and Post Ginnet, and sufficient reasons
declared to move us to graunte the same which hath bine agreed unto by
the Councell assembled, wee require you to give them their licence to
come backe by the next shippinge with such condicions or limitacions of
retorne or otherwise as you shall thinke good.</p>

<p>32. Whereas peticion hath bine made by the friends of John Tavernor,
capemarchant of the forte and store in Virginia, for his retorne uppon
some urgent occasion and for some time into England, we require you to
licence him so to do if it be his desire when you arive there; and we
doe nominate and appointe Thomas Wittingham into his roome and office,
beinge one in whose sufficiency and honesty we have greate
confidence.</p>

<p>33. There beinge one George Liste, servant to John Woodall and sent
over by him with a chest of cheurgery sufficiently furnished, we require
you to give your licence to William Wilson, his fellowe, if the said
George Liste doe stay with you, to come backe in this passage, the
better to enfourme us what medicines and drugges are fittest to be
provided for the use of the colonie against the next supply.</p>

<p>34. You shall be very wary of grantinge freedomes and of givinge your
sealle to any but uppon good consideracion and greate merite, least you
make cheape the best way of our recompence; and in those you doe you
shall give with such limitacions of retorne in reasonable time as in
your discrecion shall seeme good.</p>

<p>35. If it shall please God that you should dy either in your way or
in your governement (which his mercy forbid) before other order be taken
by us therein, wee requier and commaund that the Councell there
established open a blacke boxe, marked with the figure of one and sealed
with our sealle, wherein they shall finde our determinacion concerninge
the successor to the governement; and do, in His Majesties name, charge
and commaund every person within the precincte of the Colony to give and
yeild due obedience to him so named and appointed accordinge unto his
commission unto him, directed as they will aunswere to the contrary at
their uttermost perill.</p>

<p>36. Wee also requier you, the present Governor &amp; all your
successors, to keepe secret to your selves, unsealed and unbroken up,
all such lettres, schedules and instruments and whatsoever wee shall
deliver you soe under our sealle, especially two blacke boxes with
divers markes wherein are our commissions in cases of death or other
vacacion of the Governor untill such time as you shall find your self
unlikely to live or determined to returne, uppon which occasions wee
requier you that they be delivered before all the Councell to be opened
successively after such death or departure out of Virginia of any
Governor.</p>

<p>Provided that in all thinges herein contained, except onely the
succession, wee doe by these our lettres instruccions binde you to
nothinge so strictely but that uppon due consideracion and good reason,
and uppon divers circumstances of time and place wherein we cannot here
conclude, you may in your discrecion departe and dissent from them and
change, alter or establishe, execute and doe all ordinances or acts
whatsoever that may best conducte to the glory of God, the honor of our
Kinge and nation to the good and perfect establishement of our Colony.

ORDERS AND CONSTITUCIONS ... TO ...<br />
SIR THOMAS WEST, KNIGHT, LORD LA<br />
WARR."</h4>

<p class="center">1609/10(?)</p>

<p class="p2 blockquote">Instructions, orders and constitucions by way
of advise sett downe, declared, propounded and delivered to the Right
Honourable Sir Thomas West, Knight, Lord La Warr, Lord Governor and
Capten Generall of Virginea and of the Colonies there planted and to be
planted and of all other the inhabitants thereof, by us, His Majesties
Counsell for the Companie of Adventurers and Planters in Virginea
resident in England under the hands of some of us for the direccion of
the affares of that countrey for his better disposinge and proceedinge
in the government thereof, according to the authoritie and power given
unto us by His Majesties lettres patents in that behalf, together with a
copie of certaine of the cheifest instruccions which have bene formerlie
given to Sir Thomas Gates, Knight, for his direccion, which coppie we
have given to his Lordship to peruse and looke into but leave it to his
discretion to use and put them in execution or to beare to be advised or
directed by them further then in his owne discretion he shall thinke
meete.</p>

<p>We, the said Councell, havinge considered the great &amp; zealous
affeccion which you, Sir Thomas West, Knight, Lord Lawarr, have many
wayes manifested unto us and for the furtherance and advaunceinge of the
plantacion of Virginea have therefore by our commission under the handes
of some of us, constituted you to be Lord Governor and Captaine Generall
of Virginea and for your more safe and deliberate proceedinge in your
goverment there, have advised, constituted &amp; agreed uppon divers
instructions followinge, vizt:</p>

<p>1. First, we require your Lordship to take into your charge our
fleete consistinge of three good shippes with the masters, mariners,
sailors and one hundred and fiftie landmen goinge in them to be
transported under your commaund with what speed conveniently you maye
unto Virginea and with the first winde to sett saile for that place and
in your passage thither not to lande or touche uppon anye of the Kinge
of Spaine his dominions by him quietly possessed without the licence of
the governour of such place first obtained, unles by necessitie of winde
and weather you shalbe forced thereunto; in which passage you shall
holde councell with the masters, pilates and men of best experience what
way is safest and fitt for you to take for your arrivinge in
Virginea.</p>

<p>2. Your Lordships beinge landed there, we wishe you should (with what
convenientcy you may by proclamacion made) call into some publique place
all the governors, officers and other His Majesties subjects, aswell
already seated there as transported with you, to whom you shall manifest
your commission and cause it to be publiquely read to them, to the end
His Majesties pleasure may be knowne as alsoe our choise in
establishinge your Lordship Governor of Virginea and of the plantacion
there; and that the President, Counsell and Colony there may take notice
of our revocacion of all former kindes and formes of goverment,
constituted or confirmed, and that they accordingely may yeild due
obedience unto you, theire Lord Governor and Captaine Generall, at which
time we holde it fitt you tender unto every of them the oath of
supremacy to be by them taken whereby they shall manifest theire
obedience and loyaltie to His Majestie and you thereby the better
assured of theire fidelities as alsoe to be the rather encouraged to
comitt matter of counsell and charge unto them; att which time alsoe
your Lordship shall, in our opinions, doe well to give generall
commaundement that all former private or publique quarels, greivancs or
grudgs be from thenceforth from amongest them utterly abbandoned and
forgotten and they willingly embrace peace and love as becommeth
Christians without discention or hindrance to the common good or
quiet.</p>

<p>3. Moreover, your Lordship shall demaunde and resume into your hands
all former commissions and all instructions and publique instruments
given or sent unto them and all bookes and records whatsoever of all the
proceedings untill this time and dispose of all theire offices and
places in the future accordinge to your discretion; except the office of
Leiuetennante Governor, which your Lordship is by your commission to
bestowe upon Sir Thomas Gates, if he shalbe there to execute the same,
and office of Marshall uppon Sir Thomas Dale, at this cominge thither,
and the office of Admirall upon Sir George Sumers, if he shalbe there,
and the office of Viceadmirall upon Capten Newport, he beinge there to
supplye the said place.</p>

<p>4. Your shippes beinge discharged of theire provision, we wishe that
they, the seamen and soe manie others as shalbe needfull for that worke,
be, with what convenient speed you may, employed to theire fishinge for
sturgeons and other fish; which done we desier your Lordship should make
up the residue of theire fraight with divers of the best severall
patternes of the land, commodities that you can gett there havinge
regarde more to the goodnes and qualitie of them then to the quantity;
and to retorne the said shippes for England with as quick dispatch as
you may for easinge of the Companie of Adventurers of the charge both of
wages of the said shippes, seamen and victualls which they must be att
untill they retorne.</p>

<p>5. After your Lordship is settled in your governement, we thinke it
very behofefull that you employ soe many of your people as shalbe
needfull in sowing, setting and plantinge of corne and such rootes for
foode as you for your better provision, sustentacion and maintennance
shall thinke meete to be planted.</p>

<p>6. As touchinge your landmen, we thinke fitt your Lordship should
reduce them all into severall bandes and companies of fifties or more
when you thinke good and to committ the charge of them to severall
officers and captaines to be exercised and trained up in martiall manner
and warlike discipline.</p>

<p>7. Your Lordship is to take principall order and care for the true
worship and service of God as by havinge the Gospell preched, frequent
prayers and the sacraments often administred as becommeth Christians.
And that such your ministers and preachers as shalbe with you be had in
due respect agreable to theire dignitie and callinge and that your
Lordship, with the counsell of your said prechers and ministers, doe, as
occasion shall be offered, proceede in punishinge of all atheisme,
prophanisme, popery and scisme by exemplary punishment to the honor of
God and to the peace and safety of his church over which in this
tendernes and infancy your Lordship must be especially solicitous and
watchfull.</p>

<p>8. It is very expedient that your Lordship with all diligence
indeavor the conversion of the natives and savages to the knowledge and
worship of the true God and theire redemer Christ Jesus as the most
pious and noble end of this plantacion; which the better to effecte you
are to procure from them some of theire children to be brought up in our
language and manners and, if you finde it convenient, we thinke it
necesserie you first remove from them the iniococks or priests by a
surprise of them and detaninge them prisoners and in case they shalbe
willfull and obstinate then to send over some three or foure of them
into England, we may endevor theire conversion here.</p>

<p>9. We holde it requisite that your Lordship in causes of civill
justice, proceede rather as a counsellor then as a judge; that is to
saie, rather uppon the right and equitie of the thinge in demaunde then
uppon the nicenes and letter of the lawe, which perplexeth in this
tender body rather then dispatcheth causes. Soe that a summary and
arbitrary way of justice, mingled with discreet formes of magistracy as
shall in your discretion seeme aptest for your Lordship to exercise in
that place, wilbe of most use both for expedicion and example and for
criminall causes, you are to deale therein according to your comission
and good discretion.</p>

<p>10. That your Lordship doe not permitt any shippe or vessell to trade
or traffique within your precincte to carrie from thence any commodities
or marchandizes without warrant brought you or sent to your Lordship
from the Councell for the Company of Adventurers under the Councell
seale.</p>

<p>11. We doe require your Lordship that with what possible speed and
conveniency you may, after you are setled, you appointe a convenient
number with guides and some discreete commaunder to discover northwest,
south and southwest, beyonde the faulls ten or twelve dayes journey, and
that assone as may be your Lordship send unto us the narracion of that
voyage what rivers, lakes or seas they finde or here of with the
circumstanc there unto belonginge.</p>

<p>12. If Sir Thomas Gates be there arived and Sir George Sommers and
Capten Newport, or any of them, that your Lordship doe give unto Sir
Thomas Gates the place or office of Leiuetennant Governor to your
Lordship duringe the time of your Lordship and his abode there together,
and in your Lordships absence he beinge there to be your deputy and
cheif generall and commaunder of the whole Colonye and Companie, and to
rule and governe according to suche instructions as your Lordship shall
limitt and appointe him; and that Sir George Sommers may have the office
of Cheif Admirall under your Lordship and that Sir Ferdinando Weyneman
may have the office of Master of the ordinance, and that Capten Newport
may have the office of Viceadmirall unto your Lordship.</p>

<p>13. Your Lordship must take especiall care what relacions come into
England and what lettres are written &amp; that all things of that
nature may be boxed up and sealed and sent first to the Counsell here,
accordinge to a former instruction unto the late Governor in that behalf
directed; and that att the arrival and retorne of every shippinge you
endeavor to knowe all the particuler passages and informacions given on
both sides and to advertise us accordingly.</p>

<p>14. Last of all, for temporall goverment &amp; perticuler proceedinge
in your plantacion, in respect of the shortnes of time, we commende unto
your Lordship the copie of some of the cheifest of the old instruccions
before mencioned to have bene formerly delivered to Sir Thomas Gates, to
be used or refused as you shall in your wisdome thinke fitt, neither is
or meanes to tie your Lordship to the stricte perfourmance of theis newe
instructions but as occasion of time, place or necessetie shall requir
your Lordship may doe therein as shall seeme best in your owne
discretion. Southampton, Pembroke, Philip Mountgomery, Edward Cecill,
Walter Cope, Dudly Diggs, William Rumney, Thomas Smith, Robert Drewrye,
Robert Maunsell, Baptist Hicks, Christofer Brooke.</p>

<p>The copie of the old instruccions which were formerly with others
delivered to Sir Thomas Gates, Knight, att his goinge to Virginea for
his direccion in his goverment there, and noew are by us, His Majesties
Councill for the Companie of Adventurers for Virginea, given to the
Right Honourable, the Lord La Warr to looke into and advise on and at
his discretion to use [or] forbeare to put them in execucion.</p>

<p>Such of the old instructions which were formerly given to Sir Thomas
Gates, Knight, and nowe delivered to the Lord La Warre, beginne att the
ninth instruccion in the articles in thi booke which by waye of advise
were sett down to the said Sir Thomas Gates and soe are written ontill
you come to the thirtith instruccion which 30th, 31, 32 &amp; 33
instructions are not given his Lordship but the 34th is given him, but
not the 35 nor 36, but the effect of the provisoe followinge is

and neglect, to bringe in his or their adventure by word or writing
promised within sixe monthes after the same shalbe soe payable and

<p>And wheras the failing and nonpaiment of such monies as have bin
promised in adventure for the advanncement of the said plantacion hath
bin often by experience found to be danngerous and prejudiciall to the
same and much to have hindred the progresse and proceeding of the said
plantacion; and for that itt seemeth to us a thing reasonable that such

of their adventures, and afterwards neglecting their faith and promise,
shold be compellable to make good and kepe the same; therefore our will

or anie other dutie to us, our heires or successors, for the same, for
the space of seven yeares from the date of theis present.</p>

<p>And we doe further, for us, our heires and successors, give and
grannt to the said Treasurer and Companie and their successors for ever,
by theis present, that the said Treasurer of the said Companie, or his
deputie for the time being or anie twoe others of our said Counsell for
the said First Colonie in Virginia for the time being, shall and maie
attall times hereafter and from time to time, have full power and
authoritie to minister and give the oath and oathes of supremacie and
allegiannce, or either of them, to all and every person and persons
which shall, at anie time and times hereafter, goe or passe to the said
Colonie in Virginia:</p>

<p>And further, that itt shalbe likewise lawfull for the said Tresorer,

time and att all times hereafter, to minister such a formall oathe as by

<p>And, furthermore, whereas we have ben certefied that diverse lewde
and ill disposed persons, both sailors, souldiers, artificers,
husbandmen, laborers, and others, having received wages, apparrell or
other entertainment from the said Company or having contracted and
agreed with the said Companie to goe, to serve, or to be imployed in the
said plantacion of the said First Colonie in Virginia, have afterwards
either withdrawen, hid or concealed themselves, or have refused to goe
thither after they have bin soe entertained and agreed withall; and that
divers and sundry persons allso which have bin sent and imployed in the
said plantacion of the said First Colonie in Virginia at and upon the
chardge of the said Companie, and having there misbehaved themselves by
mutinies, sedition, and other notorious misdemeanors, or having bin
employed or sent abroad by the governor of Virginia or his deputie with
some ship or pinnace for provisions for the said Colonie, or for some
discoverie or other buisines and affaires concerning the same, have from
thence most trecherouslie either come back againe and retorned into our
realme of England by stelth or without licence of our Governor of our
said Colonie in Virginia for the time being, or have bin sent hither as
misdoers and offenders; and that manie allsoe of those persons after
their retourne from thence, having bin questioned by our said Counsell
here for such their misbehaviors and offences, by their insolent and
contemptuous carriage in the presence of our said Counsaile, have shewed
little respect and reverence, either to the place or authoritie in which
we have placed and appointed them; and others, for the colouring of
their lewdnes and misdemeanors committed in Virginia, have endeavored
them by most vile and slanndrous reports made and divulged, aswell of
the cuntrie of Virginia as alsoe of the government and estate of the
said plantacion and Colonie, as much as in them laie, to bring the said
voyage and plantacion into disgrace and contempt; by meanes where of not
only the adventures and planters alreadie ingaged in the said plantacion
have bin exceedingly abused and hindred, and a greate nomber of other
our loving and welldisposed subjects otherwise well affected and
inclyning to joine and adventure insoe noble, Christian and worthie an
action have bin discouraged from the same, but allsoe the utter
overthrow and ruine of the said enterprise hath bin greatlie indanngered
which cannott miscarrie without some dishonor to us and our
kingdome;</p>

<p>Now, for asmuch as it appeareth unto us that theis insolences,
misdemeanors and abuses, not to be tollerated in anie civill government,
have for the most part growne and proceeded inregard of our Counsaile
have not anie direct power and authoritie by anie expresse wordes in our
former lettres patent to correct and chastise such offenders, we
therefore, for the more speedy reformacion of soe greate and enormous
abuses and misdemeanors heretofore practised and committed, and for the
preventing of the like hereafter, doe by theis present for us, our
heires and successors, give and grannt to the said Treasurer and
Companie, and their successors for ever, that itt shall and maie be
lawfull for our said Councell for the said First Colonie in Virginia or
anie twoe of them, whereof the said Tresorer or his deputie for the time

expressed; and uppon the examinacion of anie such offender or offendors
and just proofe made by oath taken before the Counsaile of anie such
notorious misdemeanors by them committed as aforesaid; and allsoe uppon
anie insolent, contemptuous or unreverent carriage and misbehavior to or
against our said Counsell shewed or used by anie such person or persons
soe called, convented and apearing before them as aforesaid; that in all
such cases theie, our said Counsell or anie twoe of them for the time
being, shall and maie have full power and authoritie either here to
binde them over with good suerties for their good behaviour and further
therein to proceed to all intents and purposes, as itt is used in other
like cases within our realme of England; or ells att their discrescion
to remannd and send back the said offenders or anie of them unto the
said Colonie in Virginia, there to be proceeded against and punished as
the Governor, deputie and Counsell there for the time being shall thinke
meete; or otherwise, according to such lawes and ordinannces as are or
shalbe in use there for the well ordring and good governement of the
said Colonie.</p>

<p>And, for the more effectuall advanncing of the said plantacion, we
doe further, for us, our heires and successors, of our especiall grace

or in anie other cittie or citties, or ellswheare within this our realme
of England, with such prises, articles, condicions and limitacions as to

convenient.</p>

<p>And that itt shall and may be lawfull to and for the said Tresorer
and Companie to ellect and choose receivors, auditors, surveyors,
comissioners, or anie other officers whatsoever, att their will and
pleasure for the better marshalling and guiding and governing of the

<p class="p2">The Treasurer and Companie of Adventurers and Planters of
the City of London for the First Colony in Virginia to Captain George
Yeardley, Elect Governor of Virginia, and to the Council of State there
being or to be, greeting:</p>

<p>Our former cares and endeavours have been chiefly bent to the
procuring and sending people to plant in Virginia so to prepare a way
and to lay a foundation whereon a flourishing state might, in process of
time by the blessing of Almighty God, be raised. Now our trust being
that under the goverment of you, Captain Yeardly, with the advice and
assistance of the said Council of State, such public provisions of corn
and cattle will again be raised as may draw on those multitudes who, in
great abundance from diverse parts of the realm, were preparing to
remove thither, if by the late decay of the said public store their
hopes had not been made frustrate and their minds thereby clene
discouraged. We have thought good to bend our present cares and
consultations, according to the authority granted unto us from His
Majesty under his Great Seal, to the setling there of a laudable form of
government by majestracy and just laws for the happy guiding and
governing of the people there inhabiting, like as we have already done
for the well ordering of our courts here and of our officers and accions
for the behoof of that plantation. And because our intent is to ease all
the inhabitants of Virginia forever of all taxes and public burthens, as
much as may be, and to take away all occasion of oppression and
corruption, we have thought fit to begin (according to the laudable
example of the most famous common wealthes both past and present) to
alot and lay out a convenient portion of public lands for the
maintenance and support as well of magistracy and officers as of other
public charges both here and there from time to time arising. We,
therefore, the said Treasurer and Company, upon a solemn treaty and
resolution and with the advice, consent and assent of His Majesties
Council here of Virginia, being assembled in a great and general Court
of the Council and Company of Adventurers for Virginia, require you, the
said Governor and Council of Estate, to put in execution with all
convenient speed a former order of our courts (which had been commended
also to Captain Argal at his making Deputy Governor) for the laying and
seting out by bounds and metes of three thousand acres of land in the
best and most convenient place of the territory of James town in
Virginia and next adjoining to the said town to be the seat and land of
the Governor of Virginia for the time being, and his successors, and to
be called by the name of the Governors Land, which Governors Land shall
be of the freed grounds by the common labor of the people sent thither
at the Companies charges, and of the lands formerly conquered or
purchased of the Paspeheies and of other grounds next adjoining. In like
sort we require you to set and lay out by bounds and metes other three
thousand acres of good land within the territory of James town which
shall be convenient, and in such place or places as in your discretions
you shall find meet; which latter three thousand acres shall be and so
called the Companies Land. And we require you, Captain Yeardley, that
immediately upon your arrival you take unto you the guard assigned to
Captain Argal at his going Deputy Governor, or sithence by him assumed,
to be of your guard [for the better defence]<a name="fnanchor_22"
id="fnanchor_22"></a><a href="#footnote_22"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[22]</sup></a> of your Government; and that as
well the said guard as also fifty other persons, now sent and
transported with you, you place as tennants on the said Governors Land
and that all other persons heretofore transported at the common charge
of the Company since the coming away of Sir Thomas Dale, Knight, late
Deputy Governor, be placed as tennants on the said Companies Lands. And
we will and ordain that all the said tennants on the Governors and
Companies Lands shall occupy the same to the half part of the profits of
the said lands, so as the one half to be and belong to the said tennants
themselves and the other half respectively to the said Governor and to
us, the said Treasurer and Company and our successors. And we further
will and ordain that of the half profits arising out of the said
Companies Lands and belonging to us, the said Treasurer and Company, the
one moiety be imploied for the entertainment of the said Councel of
Estate there residing and of other public officers of the general Colony
and plantation (besides the Governor), according to the proportion as
hereafter we shall express and in the mean time as you in your
discretions shall think meet. And the other moiety be carefully
gathered, kept and shipped for England for the public use of us, the
said Treasurer and Company and our successors. And we will and ordain
that, out of the half profits of the said Companies Lands to us
belonging, one fifth part be deducted and alotted for the wages of the
bailiffs and other officers which shall have the oversight and goverment
of the said tenants and lands, and the dividing, gathering, keeping or
shiping of the particular moiety of the profits belonging either to the
said Council and officer there or to us, the said Treasurer and Company
and our successors, as aforesaid. Provided alwaies, that out of the said
Companies Land a sufficient part be exempted and reserved for the
securing and wintering of all sorts of cattle which are or shall be the
public stock and store of the said Company. And forasmuch as our intent
is to establish one equal [blank of several lines]<a name="fnanchor_23"
id="fnanchor_23"></a><a href="#footnote_23"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[23]</sup></a> plantations, whereof we shall speak
afterwards, be reduced into four cities or burroughs, namely: the cheif
city called James town, Charles City, Henrico, and the Burrough of
Kiccowtan. And that in all these foresaid cities or burroughs and
ancient adventurers and planters which [were] transported thither, with
intent to inhabit at their own costs and charges, before the coming away
of Sir Thomas Dale, Knight, and have so continued during the space of
three years, shall have upon a first division, to be afterward by us
augmented, one hundred acres of land for their personal adventure and as
much for every single share of twelve pound ten shillings paid [for such
share], allotted and set out to be held by them, their heirs and
assigns, forever. And that for all such planters as were brought thither
at the Companies charge to inhabit there, before the coming away of the
said Sir Thomas Dale, after the time of their service to the Company on
the common Land agreed shall be expired, there be set out one hundred
acres of land for each of their personal adventurers to be held by them,
their heirs and assigns, for ever; paying for every fifty acres the
yearly free rent of one shilling to the said Treasurer and Company and
their successors, at one entire payment on the feast day of St Michael
the Archangel, for ever. And in regard that by the singular industry and
virtue of the said Sir Thomas Dale the former difficulties and dangers
were in greatest part overcome to the great ease and security of such as
have been since that time transported thither, we do, therefore, hereby
ordain that all such persons as sithence the coming away of the said Sir
Thomas Dale have at their own charges been transported thither to
inhabit, and so continued as aforesaid, there be allotted and set out
upon a first division fifty acres of land to them and their heirs, for
ever, for their personal adventure, paying a free rent of one shilling
yearly in manner aforesaid.</p>

<p>And that all persons which since the going away of the said Sir
Thomas Dale have been transported thither at the Companies charges, or
which hereafter shall be so transported, be placed as tenants on the
Companies lands for term of seven years, occupy the same to the half
part of the profits as is abovesaid. We therefore will and ordain that
other three thousand acres of land be set out in the fields and
territory of Charles City; and other three thousand acres of land in the
fields and territories of Henrico; and other three thousand acres of
land in the fields and territory of Kiccowtan, all which to be and be
called the Companies Lands and to be occupied by the Companies tenants
for half profits as afore said. And that the profits belonging to the
Company be disposed by their several moieties in the same manner as
before set down touching the Companies lands in the territory of James
Town with like allowance to the bailies and reservation of ground for
the common store of cattle in those several places, as is there set
down. And our will is that such of the Companies tenants as already
inhabite in those several cities or burroughs be not removed to any
other city or burrough but placed on the Companies Lands belonging to
those cities or burroughs where they now inhabite; provided alwaies,
that if any private person, without fraud or injurious intent to the
public at his own charges, have freed any of the said lands formerly
appointed to the Governor, he may continue and inhabite there till a
valuable recompence be made him for his said charges. And we do hereby
ordain that the Governors house in James town, first built by Sir Thomas
Gates, Knight, at the charges and by the servants of the Company, and
since enlarged by others by the very same means, be and continue for
ever the Governors house, any pretended undue grant made by
misinformation and not in a general and quarter court to the contrary in
anywise notwithstanding. And to the intent that godly, learned and
painful ministers may be placed there for the service of Almighty God
&amp; for the spiritual benefit and comfort of the people, we further
will and ordain that in every of those cities or burroughs the several
quantity of one hundred acres of land be set out in quality of glebe
land toward the maintenance of the several ministers of the parishes to
be there limited; and for a further supply of their maintenance there be
raised a yearly standing and certain contribution out of the profits
growing or renuing within the several farmes of the said parish; and so
as to make the living of every minister, two hundred pounds sterling per
annum or more as hereafter there shall be cause. And for a further ease
to the inhabitants of all taxes and contributions for the support and
entertainment of the particular magistrates and officers and of other
charges to the said citys and burroughs, respectively belonging, we
likewise will and ordain that within the precincts or territories of the
said cities and burroughs shall be set out and alotted the several
quantities of fifteen hundred acres of land to be the common land of the
said citie or burrough, for the uses aforesaid, and to be known and
called by the name of the Cities or Burroughs Land. And whereas, by a
special grant and licence from His Majesty, a general contribution over
this realm hath been made for the building and planting of a college for
the training up of the children of those infidels in true religion,
moral virtue and civility, and for other godly uses, we do, therefore,
according to a former grant and order, hereby ratifie, confirm and
ordain that a convenient place be chosen and set out for the planting of
a university at the said Henrico in time to come and that in the mean
time preparation be there made for the building of the said college for
the children of the infidels, according to such instructions as we shall
deliver; and we will and ordain that ten thousand acres, partly of the
lands they impaled and partly of other land within the territory of the
said Henrico, be alotted and set out for the endowing of the said
university and college with convenient possessions. Whereas also we have
heretofore, by order of court in consideration of the long, good and
faithful service done by you, Captain George Yeardley, in our said
Colony and plantation of Virginia, and in reward there of as also in
regard of two single shares in money paid into our treasury, granted
unto you, the said Captain Yeardley, all that parcel of marsh ground
called Weynock and also one other peice and percel of land adjoining to
the same marsh called by the Natives <i>Konwan</i>, one parcel whereof
abutteth upon a creek there called Mapscock towards the east, and the
other parcel thereof towards a creek there called Queens Creek on the
west and extendeth in breadth to landward from the head of the said
creek called Mapscock up to the head of the said creek called Queens
Creek (which creek called Queens Creek is opposite to that point there
which is now called the Tobacco point and abutteth south upon the River
and north to the Landward), all which several lands are or shall be
henceforward accounted to be lying within the territory of the said
Charles City and exceed not the quantity of two thousand and two hundred
acres, we therefore, the said Treasurer and Company, do hereby again
grant, ratifie and confirm unto you, the said Captain George Yeardley,
the said several grounds and lands; to have and to hold the said grounds
and lands to you, the said Captain George Yeardley, your heirs and
assigns, for ever. And for the better encouragement of all sorts of
necessary and laudable trades to be set up and exercised within the said
four cities burroughs, we do hereby ordain that if any artizans or
trademen shall be desirous rather to follow his particular art or trade
then to be imploied in husbandry or other rural business, it shall be
lawful for you, the said Governor and Councel, to alot and set out
within any of the precincts aforesaid one dwelling house with four acres
of land adjoining and held in fee simple to every said tradsman, his
heirs and assigns for ever, upon condition that the said tradesman, his
heirs and assigns do continue and exercise his trade in the said house
paying only a free rent of four pence by the year to us, the said
Treasurer and Company and our successors, at the feast of St Michael the
Archangel, for ever. And touching all other particular plantations set
out or like to be set out in convenient multitudes, either by divers of
the ancient adventurers associating themselves together (as the Society
of Smiths Hundred and Martins Hundred) or by some ancient adventurer or
planter associating others unto him (as the plantation of Captain Samuel
Argall and Captain John Martin and that by the late Lord La Warre
advanced) or by some new adventurers joining themselves under one head
(as the plantation of Christopher Lawne, Gentleman, and others now in
providing), our intent being according to the rules of justice and good
government to alot unto every one his due yet so as neither to breed
disturbance to the right of others nor to interrupt the good form of
government intended for the benefit of the people and strength of the
Colony; we do therefore will and ordain that of the said particular
plantations none be placed within five miles of the said former cities
and boroughs, and that if any man, out of his own presumption or
pleasure without special direction from us, hath heretofore done
otherwise a convenient time be assigned him and then by your discretions
to remove to some farther place by themselves, to be chosen with the
allowance and assent of the Governor for the time being and the Council
of Estate; and that the inhabitants of the said city or burrough too
near unto which he or they were placed make him and them a valuable
recompense for their charges and expence of time in freeing of grounds
and building within those precincts; in like sort, we ordain that no
latter particular plantation shall at any time hereafter be seated
within ten miles of a former; we also will and ordain that no particular
plantation be or shall be placed straglingly in divers places to the
weakening of them, but be united together in one seat and territory that
so also they may be incorporated by us into one body corporate and live
under equal and like law and orders with the rest of the Colony; we will
and ordain also for the preventing of all fraud in abusing of our
grants, contrary to the intent and just meaning of them, that all such
person or persons as have procured or hereafter shall procure grants
from us in general words unto themselves and their associates or to like
effect shall within one year after the date hereof deliver up to us in
writing, under their hands and seals, as also unto you, the said
Governor and Councel, what be or were the names of those their first
associates; and if they be of the adventurers of us, the Company which
have paid into our treasury money for their shares, that then they
express in that their writing for how many shares they join in the said
particular plantation, to the end a due proportion of land may be set
out unto them and we the said Treasurer and Company be not defrauded of
our due; and if they be not of the adventurers of the Company which have
paid into our treasury money for their shares, yet are gone to inhabit
there and so continue for three years, there be allotted and set out
fifty acres of land for every such person paying a free rent of twelve
pence the year, in manner aforesaid, and all such persons having been
planted there since the coming away of Sir Thomas Dale; and forasmuch as
we understand that certain persons, having procured such grants in
general words to themselves and their associates or to like effect, have
corruptly of late endeavoured for gain and worse respects to draw many
of the ancient planters of the said four cities or burroughs to take
grants also of them and thereby to become associated unto them with
intent also by such means to overstrengthen their party; and thereupon
have adventured on divers enormous courses tending to the great hurt and
hindrance of the Colony; yea, and have also made grants of like
association to masters of ships and mariners never intending there to
inhabit, thereby to defraud His Majesty of the customs due unto him; we,
to remedy and prevent such unlawful and greedy courses tending also
directly to faction and sedition, do hereby ordain that it shall not be
lawful for the grantees of such grants to associate to any other unto
them then such as were their associates from the first time of the said
grants, without express licence of us, the said Treasurer and Company,
in a great general and quarter court under our seal obtained; and that
all such after or under grants of association made or to be made by the
said grantees shall be to all intents and purposes utterly void. And for
as much as we understand that divers particular persons (not members of
our Company), with their companies, have provided or are in providing to
remove into Virginia with intent (as appeareth) by way of association to
shroud themselves under the general grants last aforesaid, which may
tend to the great disorder of our Colony and hinderance of the good
government which we desire to establish, we do therefore hereby ordain
that all such persons as of their own voluntary will and authority shall
remove into Virginia, without any grant from us in a great general and
quarter court in writing under our seal, shall be deemed (as they are)
to be occupiers of our land, that is to say, of the common lands of us,
the said Treasurer and Company; and shall yearly pay unto us for the
said occupying of our land one full fourth part of the profits thereof
till such time as the same shall be granted unto them by us in manner
aforesaid, and touching all such as being members of our Company and
adventurers by their monies paid into our treasury, shall either in
their own person or by their agents, tennants or servants set up in
Virginia any such particular plantation, tho with the privity of us, the
said Treasurer and Company, yet without any grant in writing made in our
said general quarter courts as is requisite, we will and ordain that the
said adventurers or planters shall, within two year after the arrival of
them or their company in Virginia, procure our grant in writing to be
made, in our general quarter court and under our seal, of the lands by
them possessed or occupied, or from thenceforth shall be deemed only
occupiers of the common land, as is aforesaid, till such times as our
said grant shall be obtained. We also not more intending the reformation
of the errors of the said &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a
name="fnanchor_24" id="fnanchor_24"></a><a href="#footnote_24"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[24]</sup></a> than for advancing of them into

granted to Captain Samuel Argal and his associates, bearing date the
twentieth of March, 1616, be entered in your records or otherwise at all

the other respectively be made with equal favours, and grants of like
liberties and immunities as near as may be to the end that all complaint
of partiality [or] differencie may be prevented. All which said orders
we hereby will and ordain to be firmly and unvoilably kept and observed

the same to set out by bounds and metes, especially so as that the
territories of the said several cities and buroughs and other particular
plantations may be conveniently divided and known the one from the
other; each survey to be set down distinctly in writing and returned to
us under your hands and seals. In witness whereof we have hereunto set

Company of Adventurers of Virginia held the eighteenth day of November,

THE GOVERNOR AND COUNCIL OF STATE<br />
IN VIRGINIA</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">July 24, 1621</span></p>

<p class="p2">Instructions to the Governor for the time being and
Counsell of State in Virginia:</p>

<p>1. First wee requier you in gennerall take into spetiall regard and
estimation the service of Almightie God and observance of his divine
lawes and that the people in Virginia bee trained up in true religion,
god lives and vertue, that ther example may be a meanes to winn the
infidells to God: wherin wee pray you especiallie to have in daly
rememberance that the patterne which you shall give in your owne persons
&amp; in your families wilbee of singular and chief moment whatt may
soever itt shall propend. And since our gennerall endeavours and
designes have nott yett effected a due establishment of the honor and
rights belonginge to the Church and ministerie, wee must requier your
most earnest care to advance all things appertayninge thereunto,
seriously endeavoring the establishment of due order in administringe of
all services according to the usuall forme and discipline of the Church
of England and carefullie avoidinge all factious and needlesse novelties
tending onlie to the disturbance of peace and unitie; and that such
ministers as have been or shalbe sent from time to time may bee
respected and mainteined according to the orders made in that behalfe,
also for accomodatinge the churches or places for divine service.</p>

<p>2. Wee praie you likewise take care, that the people now ther or
hereafter inhabitinge bee kept in due obedience to His Majestie and that
they all take the oaths of supremacie and allegiance; and that you
provide that justice bee equallie administered to all His Majesties
subjects ther resideing, and as neare as may be after the forme of this
realme of England, wherin you are to have a vigilant care to prevent
corruption amongst your inferior officers tending to the perverting or
delaying of justice; wee praie you also to have espetiall care that no
injurie or oppresion bee wrought by the English against any of the
natives of that countrie wherby the present peace may be disturbed and
ancient quarrells (now buried) might be revived; provided, nevertheles,
that the honor of our nation and safety of our people bee still
preserved and all maner of insolence committed by the natives be
severely and sharpelie punished.</p>

<p>3. Item: that you cause our people to applie themselves to an
industrious course of life in followeinge ther buissinesies, each in the
several degre and proffession, and that no man bee suffered to live
idly, the example wherof might prove pernicious to the rest; in
perticular that you bee carefull now in the begining to suppresse too
much gaming and above all things that odious vice of drunkenes; and that
all kinde of riott both in apparrell &amp; otherwise bee eschewed; and
that an edict bee speedily published that no person residing in Virginia
(excepting those of the Counsill and heads of hundreds and plantations,
ther wives &amp; chilldren) shall weare any gold in ther clothes or any
apparrell of silke, untill such time they have itt of the silke ther
made by silkewormes &amp; raised by ther owne industry.</p>

<p>4. Item: that you use good prudence that no just cause of offence bee
given to any other prince, state or people which are in league or amitie
with His Majestie; and that no captaine or other of our Colonie under
pretence of trade to the coast of the West Indies bee suffred to saile
out with anie vessell ther to robb &amp; spoile wherby to provoke any
other nation against us; and that no piratts have cause by ... accesse
to retier with ther purchasses to the coast of Virginia, but that they
be severlie punnished &amp; ther goods confiscated: for the preventing
of which, as alsoe for securing your selves against all forraigne
ennimies, wee require your serious considerations for the speedie
errecting of fortresses or blockhouses at the mouth of the river as also
for all other manner of needfull fortifications in all places, and to
the effecting hereof wee requirer you, as well private persons as
hundreds and corporations, bee ratablie proportioned to the performance
of certaine dayes worke by the yeare.</p>

<p>5. Item: that the best meanes bee used to draw the better disposed of
the natives to converse with our people and labor amongst them with
convenient reward that therby they may growe to a likeing and love of
civility and finallie bee brought to the knowledge and love of God and
true religion, which may prove also of great strength to our people
against the savages or other invadors, whatsoever; and they may bee fitt
instruments to assist afterwards in the more gennerall conversion of the
heathen people which wee somuch desier.</p>

<p>6. Item: that for the laying of the surer foundation for the said
conversion, that each towne, cittie, burrough and other particular
plantation bee procured to obtaine to themselves by just meanes a
certaine number of the chilldren of the natives to be educated by them
in true religion and a civill course of life; of which chilldren the
most towardlie boyes in will and graces of nature to bee brought up by
them in the first elements of literature so to bee fitted for the
colledge, in the fabricke whereof we purpose to proceed assoone as any
proffit returned from the tenantes shall enhable us; and doe therfore
verie ernestlie requier your uttermost helps aswell for the improveinge
of ther labors, as for the true account and returne of the proffitts
already due, that so that busines of the colledge may goe forward with
which wee doubt not a particular blessing of God will goe a long uppon
the Collony ther as wee are assured the love of all good men here to the
plantation will therby be encreased.</p>

<p>7. Item: that imediatlie after the gatheringe in of the present
yeares cropp by Sir George Yeardlie, wee requier that the land belonging
to the place of Governor bee resigned to Sir Francis Wyate and that ther
bee delivered to him by Sir George Yeardly the hundred tenants well
furnished which wee sent him for the place; and if ther bee any of them
wanting, Sir George Yeardly is out of his private to make good the full
nomber of a hundred, which wee hope hee will gladlie doe, remembringe
our courtesie in the addition of thirtie able persons sent him the
former springe to supplie those that wee understood through mortallitie
had failed; as also our refusing to accept of his offer to depart
[part?] with all the proffitt by the Governors land or tenants, onlie
exspecting his care to cultivate well that land and to uphold that
nomber of a hundred tenants for the place.</p>

<p>8. Item: imediatelie upon the expiracion of Sir George Yeardlys
goverment on the eighteenth of November next, you shall admitt Sir
Francis Wiats commission to bee read, whom accordinglie you shall
receave and publish Governor and Captaine Generall, yealding unto his
person and place all our respect, honor and observance.</p>

<p>9. Item: the comission for establishing of the Counsell you shall
publish uppon the deliverie therof and as speedylie as convenientlie you
may to administer the oath of Counsellors unto the severall persons
therin named.</p>

<p>10. And forasmuch as ther hath ben in theise late yeares great fault
or defect in nott putting in execucion our orders of court and Counsell
for the setting upp &amp; upholdinge those staple comodities which are
necessarie for the subsisting and encrease of the plantation, which hath
happned in part by the our chargeing the Governor with toe much
buissnes, wee have uppon espetiall approvement of the industry and
sufficiency of George Sandis, Esqr., as also for his faithfulnes and
plenarie intelligence of our intendments and counsells here (wherunto
hee hath from time to time bein privie, not only elected and athorised
him to bee Treasurer in Virginia, butt also committed to his spetiall
and extreordinarie care the execution of all our orders, charters and
instructions tending to the setting upp, encrease and maintaininge of
the said staple comodities); wee, therefore, requier you that upon all
such occationes wherin the said master ... shall have occation to bee
employed, you give him all such countenance, help and power in the
execution therof as you would doe to the Governor himselfe if hee were
personallie present; and that provition bee made for convenient
transporting him from place upon all those occations; we have by order
of our quarter court bearing date the second day of May last, allotted
unto the place of Treasuror fifteen hundred acres of land and fifty
tenants wherof twenty five are now sent and twenty five more are to bee
sent the next Spring; to the place of Marshall (wherunto wee have chosen
Sir William Neuce) wee have likewise allotted fifteene hundred acres of
land and fifty tenantes now provided and furnished and deliverid to the
said Sir William Newce to bee transported this present somer; to the
place of the Companies Deputie (wherunto wee have formerlie allotted
twelve hundred acres and forty men) wee have added three hundred acres
of land and tenn tenants more to bee sent the next springe; to the
phisitions place wee have allotted twenty tenantes sent last spring and
five hundred acres of land; to the Secretarie, five hundred acres of
land and twenty tenantes sent out the last springe; for the accomateinge
of which severall persons in ther places &amp; offices in the best
manner according to our promises, furtherance that in you lieth.</p>

<p>11. Item: wee pray you likewise with convenient speed to reveive the
commissiones formerlie directed to Sir George Yeardly, then Governor,
and to the Counsell of State ther beareinge date the 18 of November,
1618, conteining the lawes &amp; orders for dividing the citties and
burroughs with ther land and people, and sondrie other particularities
for the well settling of that State. And haveing sent you coppies of all
such instructions, letters, charters &amp; directions as have here
before been sent from time to time, wee pray you to peruse them all and
what soever you shall find not contrarie to any of theise instructions
and requisite for the behouf of Collonie ther or of the Companie here,
wee wish you to observe itt as though the same were here particularly
inserted. Also all orders of courtes that shall bee certified uppon
peticions or otherwise, under the attest of our Secretaries hand
referred unto the Governor or Counsell ther, wee pray you see that a due
course bee taken accordinglie to doe the partie whome it shall concerne
right and justice, no lesse then if they had been particularly here by
name commended unto you.</p>

<p>12. Item: that the captaines and heades of everie particular
plantation or hundreds, as likewise everie cheif officer that hath
people under his charge, deliver severall catalogues at one of the fower
quarter sessions of the Counsell yearly as well of the severall names,
conditions and qualities of those that bee liveing, as also of those
that bee dead, and likewise of the mariages and christnings hapninge
with that place; and that the personall goods and estate of the partie
deceased bee carefullie keptt &amp; reserved to the rightt owners
therof; and lastlie that a list bee kept of the nomber of all sorts of
cattell in each particular burrough or plantation; and that you cause
the Secretarie once everie yeare to returne us hether a perfect coppie
of all the premisses.</p>

<p>13. Item: that whereas the principall hope of the plantacion dependes
much on the prosperity of particular Colonies or hundreds, itt wilbe
verie necessarie that in case of the death or other misaccidents of the
chief heads of those Colonies, you take into your carefull regaurd the
conservation of the bodie and sinews of that plantation united,
preserving the remaines by the best meanes that either industry or
charity can effect.</p>

<p>14. Item: that according to His Majesties gratious advise and the
desire &amp; expectacion of the whole state here, you draw the people
from the excessive planting of tobacco and that, according to a late
order of court in that behalfe made the thirteenth of June last, you
suffer them not to plaint in one yeare alone one hundred waight tobacco
the head, that is the person; and that you do provide by some generall
course to bee held amongst them that they apply themselves to the
soweing and planting of corne in good plentie that ther may bee alwaies
a large proportion not onlie for their owne use, but store also for such
as in great multitudes wee hope yearly to send; likewise by the same
generall course to cause the generall inhabitants and households to
enclose by pale &amp; strong fences some fitting portion of our land for
the keping of cowes, tame swine and poultrie; and for the making all due
provitiones for the encrease &amp; preservation of the bread of all
sorts of cattle, and in particular kine, wherof wee thinke itt most
unfitt that any should bee as yett killed and requier your vigilent care
for the inhibiting thereof.</p>

<p>15. Item: after corne, wee comend unto your care the matter of silke
which his Majesty heretofore espetially to commended unto us and out of
his owne store hath moste gratiouslie been pleased often to furnish our
Company with seed: in supply of which more hath bin since sent and a
greater quantitie shall likewise followe hereafter as soone as itt shall
come to our hands. Wee requier therfore that you cause in everie
particular plantation great nomber of mulbery trees to bee plainted
neare ther dwellings, and such as are already groweing to bee preserved
for planting, of which many excellent bookes have binn already sent in
December last, unto which wee referr you for your better direction
therin, as also to divers French and other experienced men, late sent
&amp; procured at extraordinarie charge, of whose generall subsistence
wee expect your assidious care.</p>

<p>16. Item: silke grasse, being a comoditie of spetiall hope and much
use, not with standing through negligence and want of experience, it
hath lately been declared to bee full of difficullty and hazard both in
groweing and curing, yett we doe especially recomend unto your care and
that you direct some good way to bring it to perfection by experimenting
the soiles, the seasons and true maner of cultivating of itt, being
confident that that which growes so naturally in those parts will much
more by art and industry bee at lenght brought to perfection, and being
many wayes so usefull will bring great honor an [and?] proffitt unto the
action.</p>

<p>17. Item: wee doe also especially recommend unto you the planting of
vines in aboundance and that the vignerons sent with so great charge to
the Company bee fairely &amp; carefullie provided for.</p>

<p>18. Item: wee requier also that all sorts of artsmen be employed in
ther severall trades and that store of aprentizes bee placed &amp; held
to learne ther occupations, especially those that are most usefull or
most comodious; and that you duely consider the quallities and trades of
all those people sent over for the Companies or any of the Collonies
servis &amp; that you cause them to bee held to ther trades and
occupations wherin ther are like to deserve &amp; win most bennifitt;
and not to suffer them to forsake ther former occupacions for planting
tobacco or such uselesse comodities. And here wee earnestly commend unto
your care the Dutchemen sent for the erecting of sawing mills, a worke
most necessarie since the materialls for howsing and shipping can not
otherwise without much more troble, paines and charge bee provided;
&amp; although wee have received some notice that fitting places for
ther works and not ther easilie found out, yett wee hope that dillegence
fitting to bee used in a case of so generall benifitt hath discoverid
how to make use of ther skills by this time. Nor doe wee here apprehend
any difficullty of finding accomodation for that purpose about the falls
or towards the heads of some river or brookes by the station, wherof
timber may be brought unto them verie easili and by the current of the
river the plankes or boords sawen may bee transported for the generall
use of all or the greatest part of our people.</p>

<p>19. Item: that your corne mills bee presentlie erected and pupliqe
bakehowses in everie burrough bee built with all speed and
dilligence.</p>

<p>20. Item: that all apparent or proved contracts made in England or in
Virginia betweene the owners of land in Virginia and ther tenants or
servants be truly performed and the breach of them reformed by due
punishment as justice shall requier.</p>

<p>21. Item: that you suffer no crafty or advantageous meanes to bee
used to entice a way the tenants or servants of any particular
plantacion from the place they are ... ceited and that all offenders
herein bee severlie punished and the partie drawne away bee returned to
ther former place.</p>

<p>[22]. Wee commend unto your especiall regard the providing for such
persons as have already bin sent or are now or shall be hereafter
entertained for the erecting of iron works; that all possible meanes bee
used for ther encouradgment &amp; for the performing of generall
contracts here made with the Company wherby justice unto them and
profitt to the plantation may arise. And whereas Mr. John Berkly hath
bin approved unto us here by extreordinary recommendations to bee
industrious and intelligent gentleman many ways, butt espetially for
iron works, wee desier hee &amp; his company may bee cherished by you
and supported by the helpe of the whole Colonie if need shall requier,
therby to enhable him to perfect that worke wherupon the Company have
already expended great somes of money &amp; itt is a com[modity] so
necessarie as few other are to bee valewed in comparrison therof. Upon
the successe therof also, mens eyes are generally fixed &amp; therfore
if itt should now (as by former misaccident or negligence) fall to the
ground, ther were little hope that ever they would bee revived againe;
and whereas wee have bin so circomspect as to contraict with many
masters severally for the erecting of the said works, wherby wee hoped
though some miscarried or failled others should have proceeded; if by
want of workes or necessarie materialls the said masters cannot for
present bee seatted or enjoy the conditions of ther contraicts, wee
thinke fitt you should accomodate them according to ther several
habillities in some secondarie or subordinarie places of assistance to
Mr. Berkly, or when another worke may be advanced to worke them over
that, according (as neere as may bee) to ther contraictes made here with
the Company, wherby this worke of so great consequence &amp; generall
expectacion, infinitt com[modity] &amp; unspeakeable benifitt to the
plantacion may bee dilligentlie prosecuted &amp; upheld.</p>

<p>23. Item: salt, pich and tarr, soape ashes, &amp;c., often
recommended and sett up, and for which fittinge men &amp; matterialles
have been sent to the great charge of the Company and yett daylie
complaints come to us of the want of them, wee desier you will now
prosecute and further with all dilligence &amp; care.</p>

<p>24. Item: your makeing of oile of wallnuts, your employing your
apothecaries in distilling of hott waters out of your lees of beere and
searching after minierall dyes, gummes, druggs, and the like things, wee
desier you not to forgett and good quanteties of all sorts to send us by
all shipps.</p>

<p>25. Item: since wee have conceaved itt most fitting to ordaine that a
small quantety of tobacco shall bee plainted or cherished in Virginia,
wee hold itt verie necessarie to use all possible care that the
proporcion limmitted may bee improved in goodnes as much as may bee; and
therefore that some good order bee taken to see itt well cured and duely
ordred that bringing itt into request may cause any certaine benifitt to
the planters.</p>

<p>26. Item: that due proceeding bee used in the erection of those
howses appointed for lodgeing of new men upon ther landing, according to
former directions; and that from time to time a course bee taken for
ther repaire, cleane &amp; neat; keeping likewise, for comon store,
howses in convenient places as well for other needs necessary
provitions, as upper roomes for conservation of a proportion of
gounpouder ready for use.</p>

<p>27. Item: whereas wee have many times found losse &amp; interuption
in our buissines through want of frequent relacion from Virginia, wee
therefore requier you att least to make a quarterly dispatch unto us,
the duplicate wherof to bee duely sentt by the next oppertunitie of
shipping after.

28. Item: whereas Capt. William Norton and certaine Itallians, now by
the general Company and other worthy minded adventures att a verie great
charge, sent for the erecting of a glasse furnace in Virginia, wee
hartilie desire you to afford them all favor possible. And in particular
that the guesthowses built by Leftenant Whitakers bee allowed them for
ther habitacion till they may convenientlie provide themselves of ther
owne; and that all orders given them from hence bee exactlie putt in
execucion.</p>

<p>29. Item: a gentleman's great dilligence in our affaires, accompaned
with extreordinarie capacity and judgement, haveing proceeded the
treatise of the buissnes belonging to the plantacion, approved by us to
bee full of exellent observances for those that are emmenly employd in
Virginia, as well for us here, wee sent a coppy to ly amongst the
records of your Counsell from whence, from the often veiw of former
passadgs, wee wish every Counsellor may make permanent instructions, and
no doubt much helps and furtherance may bee produced in most occasiones
for the advancement of the plantacion.</p>

<p>30. Item: that ther be espetiall care taken both of generall and
particular survaies wherby not onlie a true mapp and face of the whole
country, costs, creeks, rivers, highe ground &amp; lowe ground, &amp;c.,
may bee exactlie discoverid, but also the boundaries of the severall
hundreds and plantacions, with the perticuler directions in them bee
perfectlie sett forth from time to time, mainetained to prevent therby
future differences that arise upon questions of possestion, wherin also
itt may be fitting and moste usefull to posteritie to cast an imaginarie
eye and view, wher and which way the grand highewayes may bee like to
strike and passe through the dominions; in which course the hard
mountaines, the fords, the places for bridges, &amp;c., may nott
unfittlie bee considered; for performance of all which the premises (and
for the better sattisfaction) of the planters, whoe have so often
required ther lands may bee devided and bounded, wee have now sent and
furnished out Mr. William Cleyburne, gentleman, recomended unto us as
very [fitt] in the art of surveying.</p>

<p>31. Item: the oppressing and imoderate fees heretofore exacted in
Virginia by divers officers in valuacion of ther paines &amp; travell
for the Colonies service have partlie occationed the settling a
competent revenue to arrise therby tenants to everie cheif officer; wee
now forbidd that officer so provided for, or otherwise by allotted parts
out of the common profitt recompenced, doe take any other fees for
execution of ther severall places either directly or indirectly;
neverthelesse, that clarks &amp; such like may have a reward for ther
dilligence, wee require you by order to sett downe some small proportion
for passes, warrants, copies of orders, seales, &amp;c., or
proportionably to the merits of servants paines and attendance.</p>

<p>32. Item: the Governor &amp; Counsell assembled within a short time
after the arivall of this shipp are to sett downe the fittest months
after ther quarterlie meeting of the Counsell of State according to the
seasons and to fitting meanes for ther entertayment, together with
regaurd of the best ease and benifitt of the people, that shall have
occasion to addresse themselves unto the Counsell, either for justice or
direction; considering also the times of making ther dispathes to
England, according to the oppertunities of shiping ther comeing or
goeing.</p>

<p>33. That the Governor for the time being in or about the foresaid
time doe summon by an officer appointed for that purpose the Counsell of
State to appeare at a day and to bee together for the space of one whole
month or more if need shall requier to advise &amp; consult upon matter
of Counsell of State and of the generall affaires of the Colonie, and as
ther shalbee cause to order and determine the greater causes of
consequence or such matter as shall growe or arise within the Colonie,
either by reference or judgment; and that free accesse bee permitted to
all suiters to make knowne ther perticuler grevances, bee itt against
what person soever. And if the plaint appeare to bee important, to
record the same ther &amp; to returne a coppy ther of together with the
report of your proceeding therin.</p>

<p>34. As also to keepe a perfect register of all the acts of each
quarter sessions duely and orderlie and therof to returne a perfect
transcript unto us by the first oppertunitie of shipping from time to
time. And that at everie sessions you cause all instructions and
charters that are already or shall hereafter bee sent from hence to bee
read and so from sessions to sessions untill our directory shall bee
fullie executed.</p>

<p>35. Item: in case of the Governor death or removall or suspencion by
order from hence untill other direction from us can come, wee requier
that the Counsell or major part of them then residing in Virginia doe
imedialie assemble themselves and within fourteene dayes or sooner from
out of ther body to elect one to supplie the place for the time; and to
preserve the state of bussinesse still in the same current that it
was.</p>

<p>36. The relation of which act of Counsell wee will you send us with
as much speede as may bee, and if ther should bee an unexpected division
in the voices of the counsell that a just halfe should bee willing to
elect one and the other halfe desirous of another, then wee will that
election bee made of the Leftennant Governor; and in his absence or
necessarie cause of declining the Marshall, and in case of his default
or such refusall then the Treasurer, then one of the two deputies or the
other till the place of Governor be settled in on [one] of our said
cheif officers.</p>

<p>37. Item: whereas ther hath bin severall directions given to the
former Governor for fixing the tenants uppon the lands as well belonging
to the Governor place as other the officers seated by the Governor,
which uppon pretences hath bin allowed and neglected and the men lett
out to the heir; wee requier you that hereafter no officer bee permitted
to lett out his tenants, butt settle them uppon the lands sett out for
his place, enjoining them to enclose gardens, build howses, deviding
them into families or societies, to place them upon the land
appropriated to his office, excepting onlie the Counsell shall have
power to make a convenient order at one of the quarter sessions to
dispence with this article for the space of six months &amp; that in
case onlie of extreeme necessitie.</p>

<p>38. Item: the Governor, onlie for the time being, shall summon
Counsells and sine warrants &amp; execute or give athoritie for
execution of the Counsells orders, except in cases which seeme to
appertaine to the imediate execucions of Liftenant Generall, Marshall,
Tresuror, or deputies, wherin according to ther severall comissions or
by a conceaved order from a quarter counsell the officers are severallie
directed and authorised.</p>

<p>39. The Governor for the time being shall have absolute power and
authoritie according to the implicacion of his particular commission to
direct, determine and punish at his good discretion any emergent
buissnes, neglect or contempt of authority in any kind or what soever
negligence or contempt may bee found in any person ther residing or

such cases to bee summoned to appeare at the next quarter session of the
Counsell holdne ther abide ther censure; in the meane time if the

to bee present with the said Governor and by the main parte of ther
voices committ any Counsellor to saife custody or upon baile to appere

<p>40. Everie order and decree of the Counsell of State shalbe concluded
by the major parte of voices at that Assembly, wherin the Governor for

name="fnanchor_26" id="fnanchor_26"></a><a href="#footnote_26"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p>41. Item: wee pray you likewise to take into your care the protexcion
of the people, that they suffer no wrong by the engrossing commodity
&amp; forestalling the marketts, butt preserve them open for all men
freely or indifferently to buy or sell.</p>

<p>42. Item: wee requier you expecially to see the publicke labors to
bee from time to time equally charged &amp; burdned for the people that
one mans tenants bee nott favored above others or officers tenants
favored more then those of the puplique; and to the end those services
may fall as easy to all ports as may bee, wee thinke in the punishment
of all enormus misdemeanors, &amp;c., ill deservers bee condemned to a
nomber of days works for puplique use &amp; building, or to finnishing
of a fence or dike, or to cariage or roweing according to the meritt of
the offence.</p>

<p>43. Item: where as the Right Honourable the Earle of Pembroke with
divers his associates have undertaken to plaint thirty thousand acres of
land in Virginia, we therfore intreat you to make choice of the best
seate on that river that is not yett inhabited; and herin to take the
advise of Mr. Leech, whoe now goes over to veiw the cuntrie and to bee
enployd in that plantacion which being sett out wee desier to be
informed therof.</p>

<p>44. Item: as wee hold itt most necessarie that you provide for the
generall safety and securing of your selves and estats together, so doe
wee conceave it a matter of exceeding great advantage &amp; incouragment
to discover everie day farther by the sea coast and within land about
which wee requier you to conceave a fitting course from time espetiallie
to find good fishing betweene James river and Cape Cod or any wher
within our limmittes wherin wee suppose the new trade of commodities
found wilbe like to recompence the troble and charge bestowed therin,
for wee are certainely informed that the Dutchmen within 20 or 30
leagues of your plantacion steile a trade for furrs, &amp;c., to ther
verie great gaine &amp; content.</p>

<p>45. Item: for as much as planting of staple commodities is useuallie
much advanced by example taken one from another, wee expect that the
cheif officers by ther owne particular employment of ther people &amp;
land, &amp; setting forth the benifitts &amp; hopes of such endeavors,
shall exceedinglie advance the state of commodity and trade.</p>

<p>46. Item: wee doe moreover requier that according to your oaths and
severall charges your thoughts &amp; endeavors be unanimouslie employed
for performance of our instructions in generall, &amp; particuler that
chieflie aiminge at the establishment of the Colonie your selves &amp;
all of us that have endeavorid therein may bee comforted in a happie
apparence of prosperity of the plantacion which wilbe glorious before
God and infinitt honor, strenght &amp; profitt to our King &amp;
Cuntry.</p>

<p>47. Lastly wee pray you that no shipp that now or at any time wee
shall send at the companies charge to Virginia bee suffered to stay ther
above thirty dayes for avoiding of charge which hath heretofore grown
uppon long voydges in freight &amp; wages &amp; that you suffer not in
the said shipps any goods provicions sent thither to bee brought from
thence againe by any marriners, passengers or others uppon paine of some
punishment to be inflicted upon them; and although the infancy of the
plantacion may nott some time afford the more valuable comodities to
freight the shipps home uppon so short a stay, yett wee suppose that a
prudent course &amp; preperacion may at last afford them choice timber
as clear walnutt or some other such lesse valueable commodity to add to
ther lading which will yeild more profitt to the Companie with the
shipps quicke returne then is usueally raised by ther best comodities
when longer accompt for freightt hath drawne on a further charge. Given
under the Counsell scale the fower and twentith day of Julie, 1621; and
in the yeare of the raign of our soveraigne Lord James, by the grace of
God of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the faith,
&amp;c., that is to say of England, France and Ireland the nineteenth
and Scottland the fower and fiftith.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
